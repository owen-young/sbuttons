# Contributing

If you have a new button style you would like to add or any fixes you want to contribute, be sure to follow this guideline.

You can also join or start [discussions](https://github.com/sButtons/sbuttons/discussions) with the community members if you have any ideas or questions!

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Important Notes

1. Issues that have the label `first-timers-only` is made for beginners who have contributed to less than 5 repositories. This is a way to help people who are new to open source and contributing.
2. Before contributing to an issue, make sure that no one is assigned or has taken that issue. If no one is and you would like to work on the issue, please comment on the issue to let others know that someone is working on the issue.
3. Before creating a pull request, it is **important** that you make sure your branch and repository are up to date with this one. Some conflicts can be resolved, but many are hard to resolve. **Add the upstream** branch and always keep your branch up to date.

# Instructions

1. Fork the repository.

2. To make changes to the existing buttons, or add new ones, all changes should be made in `src/sbuttons.less`.

   1. If you're adding a new button type similar to basic, hover, etc..., create a file in `src/components` with the name preceded by `_`. For example: `_basic.less`. Remember to include the file when you're done in `src/sbuttons.less`.
   2. If you're adding a new button to an existing type (for example: animated), create a file in `src/components/<type_name>` with the name preceded by `_`. For example: `_arrow.less`. Remember to include the file when you're done in `src/components/<type_name>`.

   **Please follow the convention in naming button classes: `new-class-btn` where new-class is the button name. For example, for hover button it's `hover-btn`.**

   After making any changes, you need to compile the LESS file into CSS. To do that there you can use the following:

   1. Start command:
      ```
      npm start
      ```
      This will run sbuttons on a lite server as well as update the CSS in `dist/sbuttons.css` as you make changes.
   2. Compile command:
      `npm run compile`
      Make sure to run `npm install` before any of these commands.

3. To make changes to the website:

   1. To add new examples, make changes in `assets/js/buttons-examples.js`.

      1. To add new button colors, add them to the variable `buttonColors`
      2. To add new button types, add them to the variable `buttons`. It should follow the following format:

         ```
         {
            type,                  //type of button. Will be used for the id of the section

            label,                 //the title of the button section, which will also be shown in the sidebar menu

            classes,               //the default classes of this section. For example, for basic buttons it's "basic-btn"

            text,                  //the text to show on the button. If this is omitted, the default text will be Button

            shouldHaveRoundedType, //indicates if rounded button type should hidden or not, defaults to true

            shouldHaveBlockType,   //indicates if block button type should hidden or not, defaults to true

            variations,            //this is for button types that don't use buttonColors or don't have normal and rounded
                                   // button styling. Look at social buttons for example on how to use this

            children,              //optional. If the type has subtypes, add them here in an array. The subtypes should
                                   //also follow this same type format
         }
         ```

   2. To edit the HTML, make changes in `index.html`
   3. To edit the CSS of the website, make changes in `assets/css/`
   4. To edit the JS of the website, make changes in `assets/js`

## Notes on Creating New Buttons

### Animated Buttons

When adding a new animated button, you need to place the animation or transition that happens on hover in a mixin. Then, you need to call that mixin in the hover state and in an `animated` class nested inside that button, so that when the `animated` class is added to the button the animation runs without needing to hover the button. Depending on your button, the animation should either be continuous (run infinitly) or just once.

### Dark Mode

All buttons need to support dark mode when needed. If your button on dark mode does not look so good (problem with the color, animation, etc...), you need to do the following:

1. add a `dark-mode` class to the button.
2. add support for having a parent with `[data-theme="dark"]`.

## Button Ideas

If you would like to suggest a new button idea, please create a [new discussion](https://github.com/sButtons/sbuttons/discussions/new) with the category "idea".

## Create Pull Request

1. Create a new branch:
   ```
   git branch new-branch
   ```
2. Checkout new branch:
   ```
   git checkout new-branch
   ```
3. Add, commit and push your changes to the new branch
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "changes"
   git push origin new-branch
   ```
4. To make sure your forked repository is up to date with this repository. Add this repository as the upstream repository by doing the following:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/sButtons/sbuttons.git

```

Then, to fetch from this repository:

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master master
```

5. Go to your forked repository and press the “New pull request” button.
6. Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged.

### Note on abandoned pull requests

If a pull request is left unchanged for a week after changes are requested and the issue was assigned to the person that sent the new pull request, they will be unassigned and someone else will be given the chance to work on it.

### Adding Projects that make use of sButtons

If you come accross any project that uses the sButtons npm package, please feel free to add them to this repository.

Below are the steps you need to take when you're about to add any project.

- Navigate through this codebase to /assets/js/projects.js
- In `projects.js` you'd see an array containing objects of projects in the format below.
- Make sure you reference the link to the project's image or at least a screenshot of the project using sButtons in the projects array
- The image or screenshot should be placed inside `assets/img/projects` directory.

```js
{
    name,
    about,
    author,
    link_to_project,
    image,
    github,
  },
```

- When you are adding a new project, all you need to do is create another object that would contain the details of the project.
- Make sure all the object keys are having the required string value.
- When you're adding a project example, please enusre that the screenshot of that project of the image at least is present.
- The images of all projects should be placed inside `assests/imgs/projects` directory.
